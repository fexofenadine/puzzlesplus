            a board is only dealt at a level if it really needs that level's reasoning, the way
            puzzle collections such as Simon Tatham's Unruly grade them.

            Expert boards sometimes stop every line rule. Then pick a cell, suppose one digit and
            follow the simpler rules from it. If they soon break a rule, the cell must be the other
            digit. Lines with few empty cells left make the best places to try, since they run out
            of room quickly.
