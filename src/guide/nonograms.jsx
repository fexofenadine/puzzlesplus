            Pictures are random blobs made fresh for each game, sometimes mirrored. A picture that
            logic can't finish is touched up cell by cell until it can, so every board has exactly
            one solution and needs no guessing. A board is only dealt at a level if it needs that
            level's reasoning.

            next step. Its clue and the cells it reasons from are outlined in blue, the cells it
            settles show faintly in green, and a More button under the board opens its section here.

            Filled cells pin runs down. A run must cover each filled cell, so pushing runs as far as
            they go while keeping every filled cell covered gives tighter overlaps than the empty
            line does.

            When the quick rules stop, take one line and think through every way its clue can sit
            around the cells already known. Any cell that comes out the same in all of them is
            settled. This finds everything one line can prove on its own.

            Expert boards stop even full line logic. Then suppose a cell is filled, or empty, and
            follow the lines from it. If some line ends up unable to match its clue, the cell must
            be the other way. Cells beside long clues make good places to try.
